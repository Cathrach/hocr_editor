Partial hOCR editor file written in Rust. See https://writefreely.peachmomo.noho.st/building-a-jank-hocr-editor-in-rust. Able to navigate, edit, and add hOCR regions of various types. This was a project to help me learn about Rust and GUI programming; the GUI framework used is https://github.com/emilk/egui.

Note that this does not create the hOCR file given an image: use Tesseract (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) or something else for that.

I do not plan on developing this further, but PRs are welcome, as I am sure I did many things inefficiently or in a non-standard way.
